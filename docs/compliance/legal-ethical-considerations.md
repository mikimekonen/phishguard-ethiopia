# Legal and Ethical Considerations

## Legal Compliance
PhishGuard Ethiopia processes user‑provided files through safe, hash‑based lookup and API‑driven scanning. The system does not create, execute, or redistribute malware, and it never runs submitted files. All uploads are voluntary and initiated by users for defensive analysis. The implementation adheres to cybersecurity best practices and acceptable‑use expectations by limiting handling to metadata and by avoiding any behavior that could propagate malicious content.

## Ethical Responsibility
The malware detection feature is designed to reduce harm by protecting individuals, banks, and national digital infrastructure from phishing and malicious payloads. Its primary purpose is fraud prevention, risk awareness, and user safety. When indicators suggest potential threats, the system focuses on responsible warning and guidance rather than punitive action, aligned with responsible disclosure principles and public‑interest security research.

## Privacy and Data Protection
Data collection is minimized and limited to hashes, file type, behavior indicators, verdicts, and timestamps. File contents are not stored permanently, and no raw binaries are retained after analysis. Operational logs are secured with encryption and strict access controls, and administrative actions are auditable to ensure accountability and traceability.

## Academic and Research Purpose
PhishGuard Ethiopia is an academic, defensive security platform intended for learning, research, and capacity building. It is explicitly not a hacking or offensive tool. The system supports Ethiopia’s growing digital banking ecosystem by enabling safer user interactions, improving awareness, and strengthening resilience against phishing and malware‑enabled fraud.

## Third‑Party Intelligence Usage
External threat‑intelligence providers are used to classify files responsibly and efficiently, with strict respect for provider terms of service and rate‑limit requirements. If external APIs are unavailable, the system degrades gracefully by issuing a cautious result and advising users to seek alternative verification, avoiding false assurances.

## Risk Mitigation
Safeguards include strict file size limits, allowed file‑type restrictions, and scanning‑only workflows that prevent execution or sharing. Users are informed and prompted for consent before uploads, and clear warnings are provided when risks are detected. Retention and deletion policies minimize exposure and ensure that stored metadata is kept only as long as necessary for research and audit purposes.
